/*
The {} syntax allows to create one object
when we need to create many similar objects, 
we need to use constructor and the new operator

constructor function
1. they are named with capital letter first
2. they should be executed only with "new" operator

/*
when a function is executed with new, it does the following steps:
1. A new empty object is created and assigned to this.
2. The function body executes. Usually it modifies this, adds new properties to it.
3. The value of this is returned.

//something like this:
// function newUser(name){

//     this.name = name;
//     this.isAdmin = false;

//NOTE: If we have many lines of code all about creation of a single complex object, 
//we can wrap them in constructor function
let person = new function(){
    this.name = "Jhon"
    //other code for user creation
    //maybe complex logic and statements
    //local variables etc
}

//constructor mode test
//user new.target to check whether the function is called with new

}
test();
new test();

/*
usually constructors do not have a return statement
if there is a return statement, then the rule is:
1. If return is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of this.
2. If return is called with a primitive, itâ€™s ignored.
