    //binary data mostly take place while dealing with files 
    //(create, upload, download). Another typical use case is image processing.
    //Binary data in JavaScript is implemented in a non-standard way, compared to other languages. 
    //The basic binary object is ArrayBuffer
    //a reference to a fixed-length contiguous memory area.
    let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);
    alert(buffer.byteLength);
    //NOTE: ArrayBuffer is not an array of something
    //      It has a fixed length, we can’t increase or decrease it.
    //      It takes exactly that much space in the memory.
    //      To access individual bytes, another “view” object is needed, not buffer[index].
    //ArrayBuffer is a memory area, Just a raw sequence of bytes.
    //To manipulate an ArrayBuffer, use “view” object.
    let view = new Uint32Array(buffer);
    alert(Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT);
    alert(view.length); //stores 4 integers
    alert(view.byteLength); //the size in bytes = 16
    view[0] = 123456;
    for (let num of view) {
        alert(num); 
    }

    //The common term for all these views (Uint8Array, Uint32Array, etc) is TypedArray.
    //Typed array behave like regular arrays: have indexes and iterable.
    //Int8Array, Int16Array, Int32Array – for signed integer numbers (can be negative).
    //Float32Array, Float64Array – for signed floating-point numbers of 32 and 64 bits.
    
    //NOTE: for out-of-bounds value, There will be no error. But extra bits are cut-off.

    //Methods:
    //TypedArray has regular Array methods, with notable exceptions.
    //However, no splice, concat
    //additional method:
    //arr.set(fromArr, [offset]) and arr.subarray([begin, end])

    //DataView:
    buffer = new Uint8Array([255, 255, 255, 255]).buffer
    let dataView = new DataView(buffer);
    alert( dataView.getUint8(0));
    alert( dataView.getUint16(0));
    //With DataView access the data with methods: .getUint8(i) or .getUint16(i)
    //choose the format at method call time instead of the construction time
